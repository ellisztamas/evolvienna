#### Poster 03: Shipilina's title (Shipilina D., IST Austria)
Zoom _Meeting ID_: 111 1111 1111

We studied the lifecycle of _Kamera lens_ and found out that its components derive from recycled conspecifics. Ultimately, we show that the organism's metabolic rate increases 10-fold when being incased in a metallic superstructure.

We studied _Spongiforma squarepantsii_ in its natural habitat _Ananas comosus_. Our findings show that a specific plankton species is in a parasitic relationship with _S. squarepantsii_ which is supressed upon symbiosis with _Fromia monilis_.
